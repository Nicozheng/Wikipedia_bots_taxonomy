# The Roles Bots Play in Wikipedia - CSCW2019

Here are the code and data we used to classify bots in English Wikipedia. 

For those who only interested in the classification results, you can find all the bots and their predicted roles in the file in the root folder: `botrole_predict_and_proportion_of_edits.xlsx`.

For those who also interested in the details, you may find the code and data in corresponding folders.
